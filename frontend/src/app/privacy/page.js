            <p>
              This Privacy Policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) is issued by <strong>Werbens Business Private Limited</strong> (&quot;Company,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;). We operate the Werbens website, platform, and related services (the &quot;Service&quot;). We are the data controller in respect of personal data we collect and process as described in this Policy.

            <p>
              We may collect: (a) <strong>Account and identity data</strong> — email, name, phone number, profile information, and authentication identifiers (e.g. from Google, Firebase, or other providers you use to sign in); (b) <strong>Content and usage data</strong> — content you create or upload, prompts, preferences, and how you use the Service; (c) <strong>Technical and device data</strong> — IP address, browser type, device information, and log data; (d) <strong>Connected-account data</strong> — when you connect third-party accounts (e.g. social media), we may receive identifiers, tokens, and profile or post data as permitted by those platforms and your authorisation; (e) <strong>Communications</strong> — support or feedback you send us.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-werbens-text mt-6">3. How we use your information</h2>
            <p>
              We use the information we collect to: provide, operate, and improve the Service; authenticate you and manage your account; process your content and fulfil features you use (including integrations with third-party platforms); send service-related communications; analyse usage and performance; enforce our terms and policies; comply with legal obligations; and protect the rights and safety of Werbens Business Private Limited, our users, and others. We do not sell your personal data to third parties for their marketing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-werbens-text mt-6">4. Legal basis (where applicable)</h2>
            <p>
              Where required by law (e.g. in certain jurisdictions), we process personal data based on: performance of a contract with you; your consent; our legitimate interests (e.g. providing and improving the Service, security, fraud prevention); or compliance with legal obligations. You may have the right to withdraw consent or object to certain processing where applicable; doing so may affect our ability to provide the Service.
            </p>
